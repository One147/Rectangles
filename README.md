# Rectangles
Introduction to visual based coding and applied OOP using Pygame. 

-The goal of this project was to generate an infinite continous loop of rectangles that doubled in height from left to right and continously shrank in width to fit the proportions of the screen.

-Extensive OOP was used in order to update and re-render the locations and dimensions of previous rectangle objects as well as continously adding a new taller rectangle and changing the colours.

-For fun data analysis I also kept track of the time it took to render each of these iterations in the infinite loop to see how well my computer could handle the basic image rendering and updating.

**Program can be ran by just running the python file**
